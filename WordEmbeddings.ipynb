    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, we'll give this a try and see how it works and then compare our results the bag-of-words (BOW) model we built earlier.  We'll need to first figure out how to represent documents using word embeddings.  References 6 and 7 below suggest that using a concatenated vector of coordinate-wise minimums and maximimums works well, so we'll give this a try with 300-dimensional embeddings instead of the 100-dimensional embeddings we were using earlier for illustration purposes.  The means that each document will be represented by a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ or $\\mathbb{R}^{600}$.  We'll draw some pictures so we can get a clear understanding of what's going on."

    "**DQ1.** Start by writing the formulation of the likelihood:  $\\Pi^n_{i=1} Pr_{w,b}(y_i | x_i)$  which is what we want to **maximize**.  We typically turn it into a **minimization** problem by taking the natural log and then the negative of that.  We then search for the minimum of the **negative log-likelihood** using gradient descent to find a solution.  Because this problem is **convex**, we are gauranteed to find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQ2.**  In a real-world scenario, you would collect these reviews from an available source, but often times these reviews are not labeled \"positive\" or \"negative\".  When this is the case, you have to read through the reviews yours and assign labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-Bay get around this by having the user click a radio button that identifies the review.  This is a good idea as it can save a lot time down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQ3.** 1) No word context or language structure is accounted for. E.g. \"The dog bit Johnny.\" and \"Johnny bit the dog.\" use the same 4 words, but have very different meanings (especially if you're Johnny or the dog).\n",
    "<br><font style=\"color:white\">**DQ2.** </font>2) Sparse representations are generally require a lot of memory and computation to process (see reference 1. below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQ4.** a) We'll have a coefficient for each word in our defined vocabulary plus 1 for the bias term or $|V| + 1$.<br><br>b) Each coefficient represents the relative importance of that words contribution to the probability that the document has a positive sentiment.<br><br>More specifically, a negative coefficient implies that the more prevelant this word is in a document, the **lower** the probability that the sentiment will be positive. Similarly, a positive coefficient implies that the more prevelant this word is in a document, the **higher** the probability that the sentiment will be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQ5.** a) Because the AUC of both of these representations are very similar, this implies each representation contains a similar amount total of information in the context of logistic regression. Since the WE representation is much smaller than the BOW representation (600 vs 4500 dimensions), the WE representation contains more information *per dimension in the context of logistic regression*.\n",
    "<br><br>b) The WE representation would probably do better than the BOW because more information is contained in this representation and a CNN can more flexibly utilize this information during training\n",

    "**DQx.** For covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ of d-dimensional data $X$, the variance of $X$ in the direction of $u$ is given by $u^T \\Sigma u$.  $u^T \\Sigma u$ is maximized by setting $u$ to the first **eigenvector** of $\\Sigma$.  The maximum value of this variance is the corresponding **eigenvalue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQy.** For d-dimensional $X$, the **eigenvalues** of the covariance matrix are the variances of the data projected in the direction of the corresponding **eigenvector**.  So to find first **principal component (PC)**, we compute all $d$ sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues ($\\Sigma u_i = \\lambda_i u_i$ for i = 1 to d) and then find the eigenvector ($u_i$) corresponding the largest eigenvalue ($\\lambda_i$)\n",
